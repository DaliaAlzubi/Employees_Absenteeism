# Employees_Absenteeism
Prediction of Absenteeism duration at work.


We built a prediction model by applying cross-validation with 3 fold, and using machine learning classification algorithms such as; Perceptron, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, KNN and Logistic Regression. The evaluation of each classifier computed by using confusion matrix accuracy measure, that give a differentiation can show us which algorithm to use for building the best model. The results showed that Random Forest was the accurate model with accuracy level of 95%. The aim of this work is to predict the possible Absenteeism days for any employee, in order to help companies to know who is going to absent at work from their employees in future, so that they can define the main reason of that behavior, and this could be a new step to go over reducing the absent rate, and increasing the production level, which in turn gives optimal profits.
